						practice. Social emotional competence in children is called
						‘Readiness to Learn’ and is more predictive of life success than
						IQ. It’s defined as the ability to regulate emotions and behaviors
						and to inhibit impulsivity. The challenge is that students often
						come to school with lots on their minds. While their bodies are in
						their chairs, their minds are elsewhere. Readiness to Learn can be
						fostered through daily mindfulness practices, leading to less
						stress, better school performance and improved life outcomes. The
						IE programs help students develop a daily mindful awareness
						practice, instilling the possibility of a lifelong habit. The
						programs have a positive impact on academic outcomes including
						18-28% higher scores in reading, math and science and a 7-15%
						improvement in overall GPA, with longer times producing greater
						effects.

						practicing mindful awareness skills each day with their students,
						teachers can foster a collaborative educational experience. The
						10-minute a day program can fit within existing curriculum plans
						during normal transition times without extensive training. There
						is no prep or planning and no assessment required. Teachers simply
						launch the program from any networked device and press ‘Play’. As
						a result, teachers experienced 43% less stress than control
						classroom teachers (based on Perceived Stress Scale-PSS). They
						also experienced an 46% increase in their level of mindfulness.
						(based on Mindful Awareness Attention Scale - MAAS) Teachers also
						say they feel more confident managing their class and report that
						they can cover more academic material each day. The program helps
						teachers as much as it helps students!

						<p>As mindful awareness teachers with nearly 30 years of
							combined experience, we understand how difficult it is to develop
							a daily practice. Yet we know this is the most critical step to
							obtaining the vast benefits of mindful awareness. In response, we
							created programs that help students develop a daily practice,
							while offering teachers the opportunity to learn alongside
							students.</p>

													As one of Inner Explorer’s Co-Founders, Laura discovered
													the benefits of mindful awareness more than 20 years ago
													when she was trying to manage the stress of travel and long
													workdays. While working at GE, Laura had the insight to
													share her mindful awareness practice with hundreds of
													fellow employees. Upon seeing the many positive results the
													daily practice had on performance, creativity, and
													wellbeing, she realized it would be the perfect fit for
													education. The practices can help children navigate the ups
													and downs of life with resilience, alleviating stress and
													anxiety, and can help them focus, allowing them to be
													‘ready to learn’. -- all with compassion, openness, and
													love. She can hardly wait for the first generation of kids
													going through this program to reach adulthood! Laura
													received a Bachelor of Science Degree from Boston College
													and a Doctoral Degree in Psychology from Sofia University.
													She was trained as a Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction
													(MBSR) instructor through the Center for Mindfulness at the
													University of Massachusetts. When not working, Laura loves
													to spend time with family and friends, especially with her
													husband Rick and son Will. She loves being outside, which
													is much easier now that she moved from Illinois to Florida,
													going for a bike ride, running with her dog Scout,
													kayaking, or playing tennis. Read more about Laura’s
													professional history or email her at
													lbakosh@innerexplorer.org.

													Janice is a Co-Founder of Inner Explorer. She came to know
													mindful awareness through her lifelong (since age 6)
													friend, Laura Bakosh. Having started a mindful practice as
													an adult, she thought “If I had only had this when I was
													younger”! With the benefits of her individual practice and
													her lifelong friend beside her, she began the journey to
													bring peace to the world, starting with children. Through
													these practices, she has seen children transform, from
													anxious to calm, from angry to peaceful, from struggling to
													aspiring. She knows they are on the right path. Janice has
													a Bachelors Degree in Psychology from Northeastern
													University and has a Master‘s Degree in Education from the
													University of Massachusetts- Boston. She been trained in
													MBSR and has been teaching mindful awareness practices to
													adults and children since 2009 She is a lifelong bay state
													resident and likes to travel with her family. She feels
													that seeking out new places and knowledge goes hand in
													hand. She is constantly uplifted by her husband John and
													her son Jake and stepsons Jeremy and Brenden, and there is
													also Cooper, her crazy little dog. She was once told that
													she sees life through rose colored glasses….and she
													thought, isn’t that the best way to see life? Read more

													Laurie spent 32 years seeking social justice for low-income
													communities when she wondered if teaching mindfulness to
													kids would be a good idea. As Community Outreach
													Coordinator of Park Day School, she could not believe her
													ears when on the first day of piloting a program to bring
													mindfulness into public schools, a third grader said, “I
													think if we do this every day we aren’t going to fight
													anymore.” At that moment, Laurie knew how she would be
													spending the rest of her career. Within two months, Laurie
													and her colleagues, started a new organization called, The
													Community Partnership for Mindfulness in Education, now
													called Mindful Schools. Within the first year of the
													program, thousands of low-income children benefitted from
													the program. Laurie is delighted and feels fortunate to be
													working with Inner Explorer because the program teaches
													mindful awareness to students and teachers simultaneously,
													in a remarkably effective, sustainable and scalable way.
													Born in NJ, Laurie now resides in California. The loves of
													her life are her husband, David, her two kids, Ariel and
													Perrin, Dallas the dog, her sisters, family, friends,
													autumn leaves, whales and, of course, mindful awareness.
													Laurie’s mom used to call her Lucky Laurie and she is
													sincerely grateful for her good fortune every day. Read

						This paper discusses results from the first empirical study
						testing the feasibility and effectiveness of an audio-guided
						mindful awareness training program on quarterly grade performance
						in traditional US public elementary schools. Structured as a
						quasi-experiment, the study demonstrates that a 10-min-per-day,

						grades in reading and science, compared to a control group,
						without disrupting teaching operations (N = 191).
